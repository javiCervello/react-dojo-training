This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Dojo

Hello and welcome!

This project is an exercise to train our react skills.

We will be building a small marketplace where we can add items to a cart and see a summary about the order.

The approach is to implement the necessary code to pass our tests (TDD).

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
